## Documentation
As this repository is going to be mostly specific to documentation, please keep the following in mind when submitting docs:
1.  Think about the topic from someone not as close to it as you.  Start from the beginning and try to avoid assumptions.
1.  Avoid acronyms, or better yet, write it all out _with_ the acronym, eg. Amazon Web Services (AWS).  Later in the documentation, feel free to use the acronym.
1.  Spell check and proofread please :)
1.  Pictures and diagrams can spruce up any technical documentation.  Use a hosting service like Flickr or Imgur to host images for your docs!
